In recent years, the wave of informatization has swept across the globe, bringing great convenience and significant efficiency improvements to various industries. However, due to the cost and time-consuming nature of software development, as well as the complexity and high learning curve of management systems for large chain fruit supermarkets, many small-scale fruit retailers have been unable to benefit from the convenience and efficiency improvements brought about by informatization. As a result, many fruit supermarkets still rely on traditional manual accounting, which is not only inefficient but also prone to errors. It is imperative to change this situation.
The fruit supermarket management system, based on Spring Boot, employs a clear B/S design architecture. Spring Boot serves as the backend development framework, which is based on the Spring framework and allows Java developers to easily build, configure, and deploy Spring applications. Vue, a popular Java Script frontend framework, is used in combination with Element UI to construct a modern web application interface. Vue offers a set of tools and components that enable developers to efficiently build responsive, maintainable, and scalable single-page applications. The database utilized in the system is MySql, an early version of which is open-source and free, aligning with the initial intention of the system's development. The system includes several modules, such as employee management, fruit variety management, fruit management, basket management, and order details.
By utilizing the high-speed computing power of computers and the collaborative operation of software, this system efficiently achieves information management for small-scale fruit retailers, contributing to the vision of promoting the penetration of informatization to the grassroots level in China and allowing the general public to share the benefits of the informatization wave. The system liberates more productivity, releases surplus value for the entire society, speeds up the operational efficiency of fruit sales in China, reduces the operational costs of fruit sales in China, and improves the informatization transformation of the last mile of fruit sales in China.
